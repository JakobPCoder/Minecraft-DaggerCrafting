# Quick Guide: Adding a New Custom Arrow Type

To add a new arrow (e.g., "Copper Arrow"), follow these steps:

---

## 1. Java Code
- **Register Items:**
  - Edit `src/main/java/jak0bw/arrowcrafting/ModItems.java`
    - Add new `CustomArrowHeadItem` and `CustomArrowItem` (with damage multiplier).
    - Add to creative tabs in `registerModItems()`.
- *(Optional)* For unique logic, subclass `CustomArrowEntity` or `CustomArrowItem` and register in `ModEntities.java`.

## 2. Resources & Data
- **Language:**
  - Edit `src/main/resources/assets/arrowcrafting/lang/en_us.json`
    - Add display names for arrow and arrow head.
- **Items:**
  - This is the main Item definition.
  - Add `your_arrow.json` and `your_arrow_head.json` to `items/`.
- **Models:**
  - Add `your_arrow.json` and `your_arrow_head.json` to `models/item/`.
- **Recipes:**
  - Add `your_arrow.json` and `your_arrow_head.json` to `data/arrowcrafting/recipe/`.
- **Tags:**
  - Edit `data/minecraft/tags/item/arrows.json` to include your new arrow.
- **Textures:**
- The user needs to add `your_arrow.png` and `your_arrow_head.png` to `textures/item/`.

---

## Example File Names (replace 'your' with your material):
- `your_arrow.json`, `your_arrow_head.json` (in models/item/, items/, recipe/)
- `your_arrow.png`, `your_arrow_head.png` (in textures/item/)

---

**Keep all occurences of custom arrows ordered by their damage multiplier / tier**
This means starting with wood, ending with diamond or whatever, look at the readme for the exact damage values.
This applies to all things like code, json files, lists etc.

**Summary:**
1. Register new items in Java.
2. Add/modify JSONs for items, models, recipes, tags, and language.
3. Add textures.


That's it! Follow the patterns of existing arrows for file content and structure.
