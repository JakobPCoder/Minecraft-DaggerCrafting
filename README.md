# DaggerCrafting

[LICENSE](LICENSE.md)

DaggerCrafting is a Minecraft mod that introduces throwable daggers as a new weapon type, blending fast-paced melee and ranged combat. Each dagger's stats and behavior are determined by its material, offering new strategic options.
Also its a lot of fun!

### Blended Combat: Redefining Your Playstyle
DaggerCrafting transcends traditional weapon types, offering a unique 'blended combat' experience. Engage enemies up close with rapid melee strikes, then seamlessly transition to ranged assaults by precisely throwing your dagger. This dual functionality encourages dynamic combat strategies, allowing you to adapt on the fly whether clearing crowds or picking off distant foes.

## Daggers
Daggers are crafted using a stick and a piece of the corresponding material, placed diagonally in a crafting grid.

## Ranged Combat
When holding and releasing the right mouse button, the dagger will be thrown, similar to tridents.
- The **damage** the dagger deals on impactand the **speed** with which the dagger is thrown are based on the dagger's material.
- **Velocity-Based Knockback**: Daggers offer unparalleled knockback potential. The force of a dagger's knockback is directly proportional to its *current velocity* when it hits a target. This means daggers thrown with greater initial speed (due to their material or the 'Throwing Speed' enchantment) will send enemies flying further! 


## Melee Combat
When in the main hand, the dagger will work just like a sword, but with much less damage and a faster attack speed.

## Enchantments
Daggers support the following vanilla enchantments:

### Vanilla
- **Loyalty**
    - Unlike vanilla tridents, a dagger's Loyalty enchantment scales directly with its material's base throwing velocity! High-tier daggers, like Diamond, return significantly faster, enabling quicker follow-up throws and a fluid ranged combat experience. Essential for viability as a ranged weapon.
- **Fire Aspect**
    - Works just like in vanilla. Sets the target on fire for 5 secconds on melee attacks.
- **Flame**
    - Works just like in vanilla. Sets the dagger andtarget on fire for 5 secconds on ranged attacks.


*These enchantments work just like in vanilla. Their modifiers are applied on **melee and ranged attacks**.*
All listed vanilla enchantments, except Mending, can be obtained through an enchanting table. Mending can be applied via an anvil.

- **Sharpness**
- **Smite**
- **Bane of Arthropods**
- **Mending**: Compatible with daggers, obtained via anvil.

### Custom enchantments
- **Throwin Speed**
    - The **Throwing Speed** enchantment (Levels I-III) is a game-changer for ranged dagger combat. Each level significantly boosts your dagger's initial throwing velocity, leading to:
        - **Extended Range**: Hit targets from much further away.
        - **Increased Knockback**: Amplify the unique velocity-based knockback, sending foes reeling.
    This enchantment truly unlocks the full potential of daggers as a primary ranged weapon.

### Tips for Dagger Users

*   **Master the Throw**: Practice charging your throws to achieve maximum velocity and knockback. A quick tap is a melee attack; a charged hold is a powerful throw!
*   **Loyalty is Key**: For consistent ranged combat, prioritize Loyalty. Remember, faster daggers return faster!
*   **Combine Enchantments**: Pair 'Throwing Speed' with 'Loyalty' on a Diamond Dagger for the ultimate agile, high-damage ranged weapon.
*   **Control the Battlefield**: Use high-velocity throws to push enemies away, create space, or even knock them into hazards.
