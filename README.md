[LICENSE](LICENSE.md)

DaggerCrafting is a Minecraft mod that introduces throwable daggers as a new weapon type, blending fast-paced melee and ranged combat. Each dagger's stats and behavior are determined by its material, offering new strategic options.
Also its a lot of fun!

## Daggers
Daggers are crafted using a stick and a piece of the corresponding material, placed diagonally in a crafting grid.

## Ranged Combat
When holding and releasing the right mouse button, the dagger will be thrown, similar to tridents.
- The **damage** the dagger deals on impactand the **speed** with which the dagger is thrown are based on the dagger's material.
- The **knockback** is based on the daggers current velocity in air, so it also scales with the dagger's material.


## Melee Combat
When in the main hand, the dagger will work just like a sword, but with much less damage and a faster attack speed.

## Enchantments
Daggers support the following vanilla enchantments:

### Vanilla
- **Loyalty**
    - Works similar to the trident's loyalty, but the math for how the dagger returns is different, where speed and acceleration are based on the dagger's material.
    - Getting this enchantment on a dagger is essential to make the dagger a viable ranged weapon.
- **Fire Aspect**
    - Works just like in vanilla. Sets the target on fire for 5 secconds on melee attacks.
- **Flame**
    - Works just like in vanilla. Sets the dagger andtarget on fire for 5 secconds on ranged attacks.


*These enchantments work just like in vanilla. Their modifiers are applied on **melee and ranged attacks**.*

- **Sharpness**
- **Smite**
- **Bane of Arthropods**

### Custom enchantments
- **Throwin Speed**
    - This enchantment increases the speed of the dagger when thrown.
    - The additional speed increases the range and knockback of the dagger.
    - Available in levels I - III.
    - This enchantment dramatically increases the usablitlity of the dagger as a ranged weapon.
